## Prediction
Flight ticket prediction using machine Learning Models on different train and test data
Using python libraries such as pandas, numpy, sk_learn.
## Perform EDA analysis
Clean data and remove null value. Describe the data using info method. Mainly convert the time into seconds and make the proper dataset.
## Data Visualization
Display the boxplot to check the outlier in the dataset.
## Train and Test
Split the data into train and test 
## Machine Learning Algorithms
These Models are used in  the Prediction dataset. 
#### LinearRegression
#### DecisionTreeRegressor
#### SVR
#### KNeighborsRegressor
